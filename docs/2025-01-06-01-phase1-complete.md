# Phase 1 Complete - Foundation

## Date: 2025-01-06

### Completed Features
1. **Project Setup**
   - Heaps.io project structure created
   - Build configurations for HashLink and Web
   - Git ignore configured for Haxe/Heaps projects

2. **Core Game Loop**
   - Fixed timestep implementation (60 FPS logic)
   - Separate update and render methods
   - Frame interpolation support

3. **Scene Management**
   - Base Scene class with lifecycle methods
   - SceneManager with transition support
   - Fade in/out transitions between scenes

4. **Implemented Scenes**
   - SplashScene: Studio logo with timed display
   - MenuScene: Main menu with keyboard/mouse navigation
   - GameScene: Placeholder for gameplay

5. **Resource Pipeline**
   - Folder structure for assets
   - Automatic atlas generation config
   - Resource loading test implementation
   - Custom PixelText class for pixel-perfect fonts

### Technical Decisions
- Used fixed timestep for consistent physics
- Scene-based architecture for clean separation
- Component-based approach prepared for entities
- Pixel-perfect rendering setup

### Next Steps (Phase 2)
- Create tilemap system for levels
- Implement camera with smooth follow
- Build entity management system
- Add debug overlay

### Notes
- All systems follow the "Reuse First" principle
- Code is structured for easy extension
- Performance targets established
- Ready for gameplay implementation
