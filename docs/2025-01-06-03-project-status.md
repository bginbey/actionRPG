# Project Status - Action RPG

## Date: 2025-01-06

### 🎯 Current State
We have successfully completed **Phase 1: Foundation** and set up the project infrastructure.

### ✅ Completed Today

#### Project Setup
- ✅ Installed Haxe and Heaps.io
- ✅ Created project structure following our philosophy
- ✅ Implemented fixed timestep game loop (60 FPS)
- ✅ Built HashLink from source (though native builds don't work on ARM Mac)
- ✅ Web builds working perfectly

#### Core Systems
- ✅ Scene management system with transitions
- ✅ SplashScene with fade in/out effects
- ✅ MenuScene with keyboard/mouse navigation
- ✅ GameScene placeholder
- ✅ Custom PixelText class for pixel-perfect rendering

#### Documentation
- ✅ DEVELOPMENT_PHILOSOPHY.md - Core principles and conventions
- ✅ DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md - Complete development phases
- ✅ CONTRIBUTING.md - Contribution guidelines
- ✅ README.md - Project overview and setup instructions

#### CI/CD & Version Control
- ✅ Git repository initialized and pushed to GitHub
- ✅ GitHub Actions workflows for:
  - Automated builds on push/PR
  - Release automation
  - PR quality checks
  - Dependabot configuration
- ✅ Project live at: https://github.com/bginbey/actionRPG

### 🚧 Known Issues
- Native HashLink builds don't work on ARM Macs (Apple Silicon)
- Using web builds for development on M1/M2/M3 Macs
- Resource system (hxd.Res) temporarily disabled due to initialization issues

### 📍 Where We Left Off
We just pushed everything to GitHub and the CI/CD pipeline is running. The project is ready to begin **Phase 2: Core Systems** from our roadmap.

### 🎮 How to Continue

#### To Run the Game:
```bash
# Web build (recommended for ARM Macs)
./build-web.sh
open bin/index.html

# Or if on x86_64:
./build.sh
```

#### Next Development Tasks (Phase 2):
1. **Tilemap System**
   - Create Tilemap class for 16x16 grid
   - Implement tile rendering with h2d.TileGroup
   - Add collision data to tiles
   - Create level data format

2. **Camera System**
   - Implement Camera class with bounds
   - Add smooth follow behavior
   - Create camera shake system

3. **Entity System**
   - Create base Entity class
   - Implement entity management
   - Setup debug overlay

### 📂 Important Files to Review
- `src/Main.hx` - Entry point with game loop
- `src/scenes/SceneManager.hx` - Scene management logic
- `src/scenes/GameScene.hx` - Where gameplay will be implemented
- `DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md` - See Phase 2 details

### 💡 Pro Tips
1. The web build is your friend on ARM Macs - it's fast and works great
2. All the groundwork is done - you can jump straight into gameplay
3. Follow the roadmap phases to stay organized
4. The philosophy doc will help maintain code quality

### 🎯 Next Session Goals
When you return, you'll be ready to:
1. Create the tilemap system
2. Add a test level
3. Implement basic camera following
4. Start on player movement

The foundation is rock solid - time to build the game! 🚀
